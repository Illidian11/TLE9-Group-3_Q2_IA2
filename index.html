        <h2 class="cont-h">Introduction</h2>
        <p class="cont-p">

        <h2 class="cont-h">Gaming Career</h2>
        <p class="cont-p">
          To start a gaming career, you need to first identify what kind of gaming content you will be making. You could either record and edit videos to post on YouTube, or stream yourself playing live on Twitch. Secondly, you need to determine your brand, or the way you want to be seen. You could make relaxing or comforting videos or be loud and exciting. On YouTube, it’s much more recommended to make family-friendly content so it will be easier for your content to be monetized. The type of games you play also have an impact on your audience. A few options include specializing in one specific game (Minecraft, Terraria, Fortnite etc), or playing a variety of games. Most importantly, if you’re not enjoying making content you can always step away. You shouldn’t feel pressured to creat content for your audience because your health is the biggest priority.

        <h2 class="cont-h">Do and Don't Do</h2>
        <p class="cont-p">
          To learn how to improve your content and become popular, you should observe what other content creators do and how they got popular. Because of the way website algorithms works, if you don’t upload frequently it will be harder for your videos to be recommended to viewers. If you want to, you can hire an editor to edit your videos for you, giving you more time for other things. What time you upload videos or stream is also important, so pick a time where a lot of people are awake.
          There are some things you should remember when starting your gaming career. Because most income relies on your viewers, if less people watch your videos you’ll earn less money. Don’t treat popularity as an excuse to be cruel, always be kind and respectful. Also try not keep on responding to the comments of your videos bacause it can sometimes lead to fight between your fans and haters. The less you respond the better.

        <h2 class="cont-h">Be New In Your New Career</h2>
        <p class="cont-p">
          Before starting your gaming career, you must start a new life, meaning you must leave all your bad habits, unneccessary reactions etc. You have to start anew, be someone who will entertain people, be someone who will complete their day. In other words, be someone whom people will admire, when it comes challenges, do it in your way. Be an <b>Encouragement</b> of others, that way you can gain viewers, more followers and more people would want to watch you because you are a source of excitement, encouragement, and finally entertainment.
